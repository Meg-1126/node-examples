# Relational Queries in SQL

So far, we've only SELECTed data from a single table, but in a real world database, things will rarely be this simple. We will usually need to SELECT data from multiple tables at the same time.

## Join tables

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
```

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
```

- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
```

- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
```

## Modify data in SQL

> **WARNING 1**: Do not run any of the following commands without conditional statements. You don't want to accidentally update or delete all your data!

> **WARNING 2**: The following commands are destructive and will modify your data. No way to reverse it! Use with caution!

### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### ALTER

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```

### DROP

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
